The Beijing Web Dev & Coders group is proud to present Dive into React, an interactive introduction to React. We will teach you the basics of how to use React, a modern front end framework developed by Facebook used for creating rich interactive web applications and interfaces. The session will be led by our community member and very experienced developer Kanwar.

This session is appropriate for both beginner web developers with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JS, as well as experienced developers who would like a quick introduction to React.

Please make sure to bring your laptop so you can follow along with the interactive session and try things out on your own.
